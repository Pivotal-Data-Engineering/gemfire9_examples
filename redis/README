This sample project streams objects into GemFire-Redis and outputs the results

The input client throttles the stream at 1M objects/ minute, or 100,000 objects/ sec.
They key is composed of Device + timestamp (in milliseconds).

Processing begins with the kafka producer and ends with the kafka consumer.
